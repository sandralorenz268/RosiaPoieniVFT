## Pointcloud Index

- [RGB DJI Drone](/#rgb)
- [SWIR HySpex VS620](/#swir)
- [LWIR Telops Nano](/#lwir)
    - False Color: Emissivity bands (9615 nm, 8928 nm, 11538 nm) potentially highlighting intermediate, quartz-rich and carbonate -rich rocks. Note how the carbonate-rich road gravel lights up in yellow.
    - MWL: Minimum Wavelength Mapping showing the position of the deepest absorption feature between 8000 and 10000 nm (quartz feature), which can hint towards acidic (shorter wavelengths) or intermediate/basic rock composition (longer wavelengths).

    - MNF: Minimum Noise Fractions (3,5,9)

## The site: 
Rosia Poieni is a large, active open-pit copper mine in Romania's Apuseni Mountains, known for being the second-largest copper deposit in Europe. The mine exploits a porphyry copper-gold deposit estimated to contain over one billion tonnes of ore, primarily a mix of copper and iron sulphides like chalcopyrite and pyrite. The operation involves a multi-bench quarry for extraction, with a significant environmental impact, particularly concerning the highly acidic and toxic water discharges from the mine.

## Aim: 
Environmental monitoring and geological mapping within the EU-funded MOSMIN Project

## Field campaign included: 
- Drone borne hypespectral and multispectral imaging
- Drone borne RGB for photogrammetric models 
- Ground-based SWIR and LWIR imaging 
- Rock sampling and in-situ spectral measurement
