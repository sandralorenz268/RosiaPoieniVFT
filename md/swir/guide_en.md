## Pointcloud Index

- [RGB DJI Drone](/#rgb)
- [SWIR HySpex VS620](/#swir)
    - False Color: Reflectance bands (2200 nm, 2250 nm, 2350 nm) sensitive to clay, mica, carbonate and amphibole absorbtions
    - MWL: Minimum Wavelength Mapping showing the position of the deepest absorption feature around 2200 nm (AlOH). Note how this highlights the clay rich argillic zone on top which contains pyrite and is the main source of acid mine drainage in the region.

## The site: 
Rosia Poieni is a large, active open-pit copper mine in Romania's Apuseni Mountains, known for being the second-largest copper deposit in Europe. The mine exploits a porphyry copper-gold deposit estimated to contain over one billion tonnes of ore, primarily a mix of copper and iron sulphides like chalcopyrite and pyrite. The operation involves a multi-bench quarry for extraction, with a significant environmental impact, particularly concerning the highly acidic and toxic water discharges from the mine.

## Aim: 
Environmental monitoring and geological mapping within the EU-funded MOSMIN Project

## Field campaign included: 
- Drone borne hypespectral and multispectral imaging
- Drone borne RGB for photogrammetric models 
- Ground-based SWIR and LWIR imaging 
- Rock sampling and in-situ spectral measurement
