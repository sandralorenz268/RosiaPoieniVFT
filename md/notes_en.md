## Notebook

- Use this space to jot down notes.
- Document your observations and findings.
- Record e.g., class activities or assignments.

Double click to edit and enter your thoughts (in markdown). Use `shift+enter` to finish editing.

Any annotations[^1] you take will also appear in tables here. 

[^1]: Use `shift+left-click` to add annotation points. Two points define a line (trend, plunge and distance) while three define a plane (strike, dip, dipdir). More than this defines a polyline. Once finished, use `Enter` to save the annotation and add it to the table (or `Esc` to cancel). See the `Help` tab for further details.
