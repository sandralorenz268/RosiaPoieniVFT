## The site: 
Rosia Poieni is a large, active open-pit copper mine in Romania's Apuseni Mountains, known for being the second-largest copper deposit in Europe. The mine exploits a porphyry copper-gold deposit estimated to contain over one billion tonnes of ore, primarily a mix of copper and iron sulphides like chalcopyrite and pyrite. The operation involves a multi-bench quarry for extraction, with a significant environmental impact, particularly concerning the highly acidic and toxic water discharges from the mine.
